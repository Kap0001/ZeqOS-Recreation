There are bugs I am aware of:
	puts() and putchar() doesn't work, only putchar_() and printf() works.

Future changes:
	I want the interrupt handler to pass in a POINTER, not the entire struct, this will be fixed tomorrow.
	As of now, there is no double buffering.
	Also, as of now, the screen is NOT able to scroll.
	Also, the commenting is VERY sparse, I will comment more tomorrow to explain most of the code.
	The code is very, glued together?? (by this I mean the code is very patchy and may be unstable)
	I plan on fixing up the code tomorrow, for the sake of consistency.

As for the compiler I used, I did change the Makefile, and the compiler I used was i686-elf-g++.
Why did I use this? Because this is a cross compiler and it is great for osdev.

Here is the link for instructions on how to install the cross compiler.
